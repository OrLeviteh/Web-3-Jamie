Why is this not syncing up to GitHub?


 Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#   (commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)
#
#	modified:   Final/octo/octopress1 (modified content, untracked content)
#	modified:   Final/octo/octopresscopy2 (modified content, untracked content)


What is untracked content?
